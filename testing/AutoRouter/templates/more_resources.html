  <p>Here are some more resources to help you further secure your network:</p>
  <div>1. If our program managed to log into your router, make sure you pick a strong and unique password so that it's not as easy to guess

  </div>
  <div>2. You should change your SSID (wifi name) so that it does not reveal any personal information about you. Things such as appartment number, names, and manufacturer can help attackers break into your network

  </div>
  <div>3. Make sure the firmware (the program running on your router) is up to date. Router manufacturers provide firmware updates to patch vulnerabilities as they are discovered and keeping it up to date means that hackers have one less method of breaking in

  </div>
  <div>4. See if you have WPA3 or WPA2 options in your router settings, if so, turn them on, if not, consider updgrading to a newer router

  </div>
  <div>5. Make sure "remote management" is off. Remote management prevents hackers from being able to access your router's login page from outside of your home network.

  </div>
  <div>6. Turn off WPS. Routers that have a WPS button on them makes it super easy for hackers to gain access to your network with a push of a button and that would just be too easy not wouldn't it?

  </div>
  <div>7. Turn off Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). UPnP allows devices on the same network to see each other. This makes all your devices on the network vulnerable to attack if one device gets compromised

  <div>8. Having guests? Consider turning on a guest network that separates your guests' devices from your personal ones.
